Hello, I'm Nathan. I'm new to this! 

I'm interested in full stack development and databases. Currently a post-Bacc Computer Science student at Oregon State.

Other interests? Too many: hiking, travel, gardening, languages, nonfiction, urban planning, transportation, old cars, old postcards, old maps, cooking

Iâ€™m currently learning JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and data structures. I know a little bit of Python and enough NodeJS to get in a little trouble. In addition to OSU coursework, I am slowly working through Angela Yu's Web Development course on Udemy, and some modules in fullstackopen. 

Summer 2022 goals: 
 * Learn SQL well (in progress). 
 * Learn the fundamentals of DBs (in progress). 
 * Figure out how APIs work (in progress). 
 * Build a simple app with Flask (in progress). 
 * Build a simple app with Django. 
 * Create a data visualization project with matplotlib. 
 * Eat lots of fresh vegetables from the garden (in progress).
 * Enjoy the sunshine, flowers, and warmth (in progress).
