Hello, I'm Nathan. I'm new to this! 

I'm interested in backend development and working with databases. Currently a post-Bacc Computer Science student at Oregon State.

Other interests? Too many: hiking, travel, gardening, languages, nonfiction, urban planning, transportation, old cars, old postcards, old maps, cooking

Iâ€™m currently learning more about cloud development and APIs. 

Languages: Python, C, SQL, and a little JS

2023 goals: 
 * Improve SQL and DB fundamentals.
 * Create a data visualization project with matplotlib. 
 * Hike in Utah and/or Oregon
 * Find a terrific new backend developer job!
